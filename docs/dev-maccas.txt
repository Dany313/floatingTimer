copy from scratch
https://github.com/TorryDo/Floating-Bubble-View

just stick everything in tmp

read code top to bottom, where is he adding view to window manager

might be able to have 100% opacity if my way works out
  switch overlay rendered in click target to fullscreen overlay when drag starts

communicate to service through user_prefs
that way can recover, no need to read intent onStartCommand

start the ui in service oncreate

refactor overlayViewFactory using https://github.com/KuhakuPixel/UberAlles/

remove tmp activity and service from manifest.xml
