 ok so it only occurs for api => 30

 solution, rewrite as 1 service that supports multiple overlays

 bug cause
 https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/WindowManager.LayoutParams#FLAG_NOT_TOUCHABLE
  opacity({A,B}) = 1 - (1 - opacity(A))*(1 - opacity(B)) <= 0.8
  this is because multiple fullscreenoverlays
