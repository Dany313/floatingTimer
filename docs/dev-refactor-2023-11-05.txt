work on FloatingCountdownTimer-refactor-tmp
  
can i remove kapt plugin gradle?

use withContext(Main.immediate) to collect flows
  will this prevent ANRs

cull xxx, tmp, todo, find in files

write a bunch of manual tests for each line of code removed from Xxx classes

print code to cull, write tests, cross out safe to cull

exit timer, MVI... event: exit, data: bubble
// if no bubbles left stop service

next task, countdown bubble
refactor abstract class
MutableSet bubble

doitwrong
  AlarmReceiver
  future just use a foreground service
    or ditch AlarmReceiver, pendingIntent to floatingservice direct

future
android 14 permission
  foreground service special use
  ditch alarm permission
this is going to be such a headache

home screen - button "Cancel All Timers"

remove AlarmReceiver
