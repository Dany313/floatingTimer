work on FloatingCountdownTimer-refactor-tmp
  
can i remove kapt plugin gradle?

refactor - bound service

use withContext(Main.immediate) to collect flows
  will this prevent ANRs

move CountDownTimer out of alarmcontroller
  ???

cull xxx, tmp, todo, find in files

step 1, stopwatch add view

feature, button "exit all timers"

step 1, bound service

write a bunch of manual tests for each line of code removed from Xxx classes

service ondestroy, cancel alarms ???

start stop stopwatch
drag to trash....

configuration change

countdown timer

Stopwatch, Countdown : Bubble()
  override exit
alarm contoller

print code to cull, write tests, cross out safe to cull

multiple timers paywall UX design

exit timer, MVI... event: exit, data: bubble
// if no bubbles left stop service

next task, countdown bubble
refactor abstract class
MutableSet bubble
